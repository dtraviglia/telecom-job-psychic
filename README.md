Predict Telecommunication Repair Job Demands
===================

This iPython notebook documents our class project to explore, analyze, model, and predict the demand for telecommunication repair jobs based on weather and time-related phenomena.  

## Documentation

Please see our [website](http://dtraviglia.github.io/telecom-job-pyschic/) for more information.  

## Installation

You'll need to install [iPython](http://ipython.org/install.html) and [iPython notebook](http://ipython.org/install.html) to use our project file.  The best way to do this though is to just install [Anaconda](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html).  

## Developing and Contributing

We'd love to hear your thoughts on our project work!  We've put lots of effort into this project and have completed our own exploration, analysis, and modeling of the data but there are more areas to explore and plenty of ideas to test.  

Please contact us if you'd like to merge your changes into our notebook.
