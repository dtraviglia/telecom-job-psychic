          <p>A repository for our data science class project that focuses on predicting repair jobs for telecom providers</p>
          <div id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> Telecom services, such as voice, data, and video services, are delivered on various telecommunication networks to subscribersâ€™ homes and businesses. Failures and operating problems associated with the network and network equipment cause service problems in which some of them can be fixed remotely and others require dispatch of technicians to the site to repair and fix the problem(s). Managing the available resources and their capacity in executing the repair jobs is quite challenging because the daily volume of dispatch needs (jobs demand) is largely unpredictable due to several factors such as the characteristics of the network and network equipment, nature of repairs needed, regulations, weather, seasonality, and characteristics of the labor force (such as union membership, skills, culture); among others. On the other hand, if extra resources and capacity is secured, the cost to secure these resources in addition to unplanned overtime cost can be substantial. If a lack of resources and capacity exists, then broken promises and negative customer experiences occur which typically affects customer satisfaction. The ability to predict the jobs demand in advance for immediate and near short terms can provide substantial benefits in optimizing capacity, reducing network downtime and improving customer satisfaction.</p>
            <h3> Objectives </h3>
            <p> We sought to develop a statistical model to predict the daily and 21-day period demands for telecom repair services to help in optimizing repairs resources capacity, improve operational effectiveness, reduce overtime cost and improve customer services. </p><p>Our inital hypothesis is that the number of repair jobs is related to weather conditions plus seasonality or some other time related phenomena. This project will help us identify and develop a model for repair jobs based based on this idea. </p>

            <h2>Dataset Descriptions</h2>
            <p>The Boston data included 2 years of daily measurements for actual repairs, weather data forecasts and measurements, and other repair center metadata. </p>
            <p>Specifically We obtained raw data to be used for the model development and testing that included:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:square">
              <li>Historical time series actual repairs dispatch job for a service area (zip code),</li>
              <li>Historical weather data for the geographical area covered by the repairs service center,</li>
              <li>Forecasted weather data for the geographical area covered by the repairs service center, and</li>
              <li>Metadata on the repairs center, the day of the week, and holidays</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The weather data is commercially available from Accuweather and the jobs data are available from a major telecom provider for two independent geographical service areas.</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
              <li>02116 - Boston, Massachusetts</li>
              <li>02865 - Lincoln, Rhode Island</li>
            </ul> 
          </div>
          <div id="eda">
            <h2>Exploratory Analysis</h2>
            <p>The repairs jobs data from the centers were accumulated at the group level since capacity planning is also mainly conducted at the group level.  The repairs jobs data for Boston included the repairs jobs for period from 1/1/2013 to the 10/18/2014.  The weather data for the same time period were previously obtained from a commercial source (Accuweather.com) and linked to the repairs jobs based on the zipcode and date.</p>

              <figcaption> The data above shows the distribution of our data. The repair jobs have a standard deviaiton that is more than half of the mean which makes it difficult to optimally plan resources.</figcaption>
